		<h1>Achievement </h1>

 Nikola Tesla was an inventor who obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. 
  He was, without a doubt, genius who is not only credited with many devices we use today, 
  but is also credited with astonishing, sometimes world-transforming, devices that are even simply amazing by today's scientific standards. 
  Tesla sailed to America in 1884, arriving in New York City with four cents in his pocket, and many great ideas in his head. Some of his ideas were brought to life: Tesla discovered X-rays and remote radio. The Tesla Coil, which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other electronic equipment for wireless communication. He managed to produce new forms of generators, transformers, he invented the fluorescent light, and he became extremely involved with the wireless transmission of power. coil Interesting fact: The famous Tesla Tower and Tesla Laboratory was built by Nikola Tesla from 1901 to 1905, in Shoreham, Long Island. It was intended to become the first broadcasting system in the world.
  The tower's purpose was also to transmit electrical energy without wires from the huge electricity reserve in Niagara Falls, and transmitted through the Ionosphere and the ground to the whole planet.  
  Tesla wanted to saturate the surface of the globe with electricity for global use.  
The financer of the huge project was JP Morgan, who later asked how are we going to charge consumers for this electricity?  Without a clear answer to this question, Morgan discontinued financial support for Wardenclyffe Tower. And we still pay for electricity…</p>

<h2 >Alternating current</h2>

<p><img src="images/alter.jpg" class="imageLeft">It all began in 1893 at the World's Expo in Chicago where the feud between Edison's direct current and Tesla's alternating current culminated. Edison's direct current was very dangerous and costly over long distances. Tesla sought to implement alternating current for the power grid because it was cheaper and safer. To prove the safety of AC, he reportedly sent electricity through himself to produce light. Despite Edison's and General Electric's efforts to implement direct current, Tesla's alternating current eventually won out.</p>

<h2 >First hydro-electric power plant</h2>

<p>Nikola Tesla along with George Westinghouse constructed the world's first hydro-electric power plant at the base of Niagra Falls. The power plant remains to this day as a museum, but it was one of the first energy generation locations that started the process of electrifying the world.</p>

<h2>X-rays</h2>

<p>At the time of Tesla's life, ionizing radiation and electromagnetism were heavily studied subjects. His early experiments with x-ray imaging eventually led to its implementation in the medical field. The discovery of x-rays was one that Tesla found through his quest to understand the unseen forces in the world around him. This drive ultimately is what made tesla such a profoundly amazing inventor.</p>

<h2>Tesla's induction motor</h2>

<p><img src="images/induction motor.jpg" class="imageRight">Proclaimed as one of the 10 greatest inventions of all time, Tesla's induction motor revolutionized was what possible in the appliance industry. It was the first instance where electrical energy could be sustainably converted to mechanical energy. This gave way to compact mixing machines to washing machines among many other things. Essentially all modern electronics that utilize electric motors can thank Tesla for their existence.</p>

<h2>Measurement of flux density</h2>

<p>One of the lesser known of Tesla's achievements is the foundation of a reliable unit in the measurement of magnetic flux density. Tesla discovered rotating magnetic fields in 1882, which served as a core discovery around alternating current. Rotating magnetic fields are used in a wide array of fields, with an MRI machine the forefront of the technology. Tesla was honored with the international unit of flux density used to describe the strength of magnetic fields in 1956.</p>

<h2>Wireless transmission</h2>

<p><img src="images/tower.jpg" class="imageLeft">One of Tesla's greatest inventions and predictions of the future was that of wireless data and energy transmission. J.P. Morgan invested $150,000 into Tesla's idea of wireless transmission with the goal of finding frequencies which data could transmit across. The tower that Tesla built was the world's first wireless transmission system, and his ideas in this field laid the groundwork for the possibility of modern wireless data.</p>

<p>Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity, wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, saturating the schoolroom with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath. The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell. Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.</p>
